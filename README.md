# GitLite Control System

A C++ project that efficiently manages CSV data using **AVL Trees** or **Red-Black Trees** for indexing, with **Merkle Trees** for data integrity and Git-like version control features.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

GitLite is a lightweight version control and database management system developed in C++. It supports efficient data storage and retrieval using self-balancing trees and ensures data integrity through Merkle trees. The system offers basic Git-inspired functionalities such as branching, committing, and version tracking â€” ideal for educational use and systems that require version-controlled structured data.

## ðŸ§© Features

### ðŸŒ³ Core Functionalities

- **Tree Structures**
  
  - Supports both **AVL Trees** and **Red-Black Trees**.
    
  - Ensures balanced and efficient data insertions, deletions, and lookups.

- **CSV Integration**
  
  - Loads and parses CSV files to populate the database.
    
  - Supports dynamic updates to records.

### ðŸ”§ Git-like Version Control

- **Branching**
  
  - Create and manage multiple branches of data.
  
- **Committing**
  
  - Track changes in data structure and content.
    
  - Store versions of the database efficiently.

- **Version History**
  
  - View and navigate through past commits.
    
  - Checkout previous versions for rollback or comparison.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

  - Download the source.cpp
    
  - Run it in Visual Studio. Make an empty project and add a .cpp file
    
  - In Solution Explorer, right-click your project name (not the solution).
    
  - Click Properties.
    
  - Then go to Configuration Properties â†’ C/C++ â†’ Language
    
  - Find the setting : C++ Language Standard
    
  - Set it to : ISO C++17 Standard (/std:c++17)  or ISO C++20 Standard (/std:c++20)
    
  - Make sure to replace the filename in the code to your file.
